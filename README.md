## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a custom PCB relay driver module for controlling a 12V load using a 5V microcontroller. One way for the design to be implemented in a system is my self-sorting recycling bin application, where the board integrates a BJT switching stage, a PCB-mounted electromechanical relay, and flyback protection to safely manage inductive loads. The self-sorting recycling trash bin will be a part of this development of the PCB, where I plan to implement a motor for the deflector plate of the bin to fully automate sorting metal and plastic into their designated sections. The design will isolate low-power control signals from high-current switching components, providing a safe, modular, and manufacturable hardware solution. The objective is to move from prototype wiring to a safer and more professional, repeatable PCB implementation suitable for real-world application.

## Educational Value Added

This project strengthens my understanding of power electronics, PCB design, and real-world system integration. Through designing this BJT relay driver PCB, I developed hands-on experience with BJT implementation on PCB and tracing the wires for power and ground. 
It also enhanced my skills in schematic capture, PCB layout, component selection, and manufacturing preparation using KiCad. Moving from a breadboard prototype to a fabricated PCB required deeper thinking about trace routing, current handling, and modular system design. 
Additionally, integrating the PCB into a self-sorting recycling bin expands my experience in embedded systems, motor control, and automation. This project connects theory from coursework to practical hardware implementation, improving my understanding on Arduino and electromagnet communication with the PCB.

## Tasks
(Will be modified)
1. Finalize schematic review and verify all component values and connections
2. Assemble and solder all PCB components (relay, BJT, diodes, capacitors, headers) 
3. Perform continuity and short-circuit checks before power-up Test relay switching using a controlled 12V supply without load 
4. Validate flyback diode protection under switching conditions 
5. Integrate Arduino control signal and verify reliable switching logic 
6, Connect and test 12V electromagnet under real operating conditions 
7. Implement motor control for the deflector plate in the recycling bin system Debug and optimize wiring, grounding, and system stability Document test results and system performance
